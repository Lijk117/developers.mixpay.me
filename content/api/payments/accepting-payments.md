## Endpoint URL

```
https://api.mixpay.me/v1/payments
```

## Parameters

|  Param | Optional | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `payeeId` | <span class="required">*required</span> | String | three settlement modes are supported, normal user, robot, and multisig group, so it is usually the Mixin UUID of a normal user or robot, and you can also specify the multisigId of a sub-account. |
| `orderId` | <span class="required">*required</span> if no `traceId` | String | Unique in your system. String lengths **between 6-36** must be letters, numbers, dashes and underscores and NOT space. `orderId` and `payeeId` make a payment unique. |
| `paymentAssetId` | <span class="required">*required</span> | String | `assetId` of payment cryptocurrency. |
| `settlementAssetId` | <span class="required">*required</span> | String | `assetId` of settlement cryptocurrency. Settlement assets you prefer. |
| `quoteAmount` | <span class="required">*required</span> | Numeric | Corresponding to the amount of quoteAssetId, for example, the current commodity value is 10 USD |
| `quoteAssetId` | <span class="required">*required</span> | String | `assetId` of quote cryptocurrency, the asset include cryptocurrency and fiat currency. |
| `traceId` | optional | String |  UUID, used to prevent double payment and checking the payment result. You should use `orderId` instead.  |
| `clientId` | optional | String | UUID of client of the payment. |
| `paymentAmount` | optional | Numeric | The `quoteAmount` parameter is invalid when `paymentAmount` is not null. |
| `settlementMethod` | optional | String | Instant settlement wallet. This parameter has two values, `mixin` and `mixpay. The default is `mixin`. |
| `remark` | optional | String | maximum 50. Payment remark viewable by the payee. |
| `note` | optional | String | maximum 50. Payment note viewable by the payer. |
| `settlementMemo` | optional | String | maximum 200. A memo is similar to Mixin Snapshots, this parameter you can customize. This parameter only takes effect when your `settlementMethod` is equal to `mixin`. |
| `returnTo` | optional | String | After successful payment, the URL page will want to redirect to. Useful when you are in a browser JavaScript environment. |
| `failedReturnTo` | optional | String | After payment failure, the URL page will want to redirect to. Useful when you are in a browser JavaScript environment. |
| `callbackUrl` | optional | String | After payment successfully, MixPay will issue a POST request to this URL on our server-side. For security reasons, URLs only support HTTPS.  |
| `expiredTimestamp` | optional | int | Set a expired [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). This value must be greater than 10s and less than 240min. After this period, the payment result status field will be marked as `failed`, and the `failureReason` will be `Payment overtime`. If you are not setting this value, the payer can have unlimited time to complete this payment. |
## Callback

As mentioned above, you can pass a `callbackUrl` parameter to this API. 

After payment successfully, MixPay will issue a POST request to this URL, with the following JSON content as an example:

```json
{
  "orderId": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "traceId": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "payeeId": "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

**For security reasons, we can not pass the payment result in this process.**

When your callback endpoint receives a call:

- First, in your database, look for the incoming `orderId` or `traceId` value. **This step is essential, be careful anyone can post a fake value to your endpoint**;
- If the previous step has a match, then call the [payments-results API](https://developers.mixpay.me/api/payments/payments-results), and check for `status` field to be `success`;
- Only when the `status` filed is `success`, now you can safely mark your order as completed. 

Your endpoint should return an HTTP status 200 with the following JSON data:

```json
{  
  "code": "SUCCESS"
}
```

Anything `code` not equal to `SUCCESS`, we will see it as a failure, then our server will retry at 0s/15s/15s/30s/180s/1800s/1800s/1800s/1800s/3600s, a total 10 times。

#### INFO

`settlementMemo` parameter explanations: If you use Mixin API like [GET /snapshots](https://developers.mixin.one/docs/api/transfer/snapshots), you can find the `memo` in this response. This memo is the settlementMemo set by you. If you don't use this parameter, the specification of the memo can be found [here](https://developers.mixpay.me/api/memo).
