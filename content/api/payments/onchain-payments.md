| `callbackUrl` | optional | String | After payment successfully, MixPay will issue a POST request to this URL on our server-side. For security reasons, URLs only support HTTPS.  |
| `expiredTimestamp` | optional | int | Set a expired [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). This value must greater than 10s, and less than 240min. After this time period the payment result `status` field will be mark as `failed`, and the `failureReason` will be `Payment overtime`. |

## Callback

As mentioned above, you can pass a `callbackUrl` parameter to this API. 

After a payment is finish (either success or failure), MixPay will issue a POST request to this URL, with the following JSON content as a example:

```json
{
  "orderId": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "traceId": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "payeeId": "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

**For security reason, we can not passing the payment result in this proccess.**

When your callback endpoint receive a call:

- First in your database look for the incoming `orderId` or `traceId` value. **This step is important, be careful anyone can post a fake value the your endpoint**;
- If the previous step have a match, then call the [payments-results API](https://developers.mixpay.me/api/payments/payments-results), and check for `status` field to be `success`;
- Only when the `status` filed is `success`, now you can safely mark your order as completed. 

Your endpoint should return a HTTP status 200 with the following JSON data:

```json
{  
  "code": "SUCCESS"
}
```

Anything `code` not equal to `SUCCESS`, we will see it as failure, then our server will retry at 0s/15s/15s/30s/180s/1800s/1800s/1800s/1800s/3600s, total 10 time。
