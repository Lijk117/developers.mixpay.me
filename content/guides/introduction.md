MixPay is a decentralised crypto payments service platform built on [Mixin Network](https://developers.mixin.one/docs/introduction).

MixPay is decentralised and supports Mixin Messenger and any on-chain wallet for payments. MixPay is very flexible because of its underlying ability to separate the three parts of quotes, payment, and settlement. MixPay supports three settlement modes: regular user, robot, and multi-signature group.

You only need to specify a certain amount of currency to MixPay, the user chooses any cryptocurrency to pay, and MixPay converts them automatically. For example, suppose there is a current commodity valued at $10 that needs to be paid, the merchant can choose to charge $10 in BTC or any cryptocurrency, and the user can choose to pay $10 in USDT or any cryptocurrency. And all this can be achieved only by scanning the QR code using [Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger) or any on-chain wallets.
