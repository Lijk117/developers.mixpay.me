Let's assume a scenario where someone goes to your store to buy something, he needs to pay you $10, and you want to receive BTC. But how do you receive payments in your store or at the POS with MixPay? Get started accepting crypto payments by following along in our step-by-step integration guide.

For example, you need to charge $10 in BTC, we can do this (You can copy the link and open it in a brower:):

```
https://mixpay.me/pay?payeeId=a38ed284-5689-4fb9-8c2a-91fba5e32ce9&settlementAssetId=c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa&quoteAssetId=usd&amount=10
```

You just need to ask someone to open this link to pay.

If you want to exchange 0.01 BTC to ETH, you need to do a lot of work. But if you use MixPay, you only need to make a simple request.

```
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://api.mixpay.me/v1/payments --data PAYLOAD
```

```json

    "amount": "0.01",
