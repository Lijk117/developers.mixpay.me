## Introduction

Before you get started, all you need to know is that it takes only three steps to integrate MixPay into the Point-of-Sale (PoS) system. They are as follows.

1.  Create the payment link.
2.  Convert the payment link to a QR code.
3.  Users scan the QR code to pay and the Point-of-Sale (PoS) system look query the payment results.

More about MixPay, you can check [this](https://developers.mixpay.me/guides/introduction) for reference.

## For Point-of-Sale (PoS) developers

Before you start, you need to know that through API of MixPay, the crypto paid by the user is settled directly to your Mixin bot, MixPay user or Mixin Wallet.

Mixin bot and MixPay user (ID of MixPay user is equal to Mixin ID) both have the same parameter, called **UUID**. This UUID is very important and determines the destination of the money received. So this UUID needs to be configurable. The assets in your Mixin bot are programmable, and the assets in MixPay you can withdraw and manage easily.

Next we start a detailed guide.

### Step 1 - Create the payment link

1.  There is no need to register MixPay to use MixPay API. You can just use MixPay API with your preferred languages. MixPay API click [here](https://developers.mixpay.me/api/overview).
2.  Also, you can use this bot(7000101422) to get the Mixin UUID, just send the Mixin ID in the chat window to the bot. It's simple and no programming required. Also you can get this UUID via this [API](https://developers.mixin.one/docs/api/users/search), and you can click [here](https://developers.mixin.one/docs/dapp/getting-started/create-dapp) for the tutorial.
3.  The ID of cryptocurrency you need to acquire. The type of assets is used for settlement and quote. Also you can click [here](https://developers.mixpay.me/guides/assets) for the detail about supported assets.

:::note
Settlement assets support cryptocurrency and fiat currency, if you need fiat currency for settlement, just contact Robin(Mixin ID: **[26930](https://mixin.one/codes/89f7e832-ff53-4fff-ad47-10c68ec96ae2)**) to apply. And the Settlement assets parameter is best made configurable for easy replacement by merchants.
:::

1.  You can use this [api](https://developers.mixpay.me/api/payments/pay) to integrate with MixPay. The specific parameters are like below. And you can convert this url to QR code, and the customers scan the QR code to pay.

And the `traceId` you can generate randomly. If you use Golang, the sample code is like below.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/google/uuid"
)

func main() {
    id := uuid.New()
    fmt.Println(id.String())
}
```

Assuming the `traceId` is dd9c3e04-a5d2-11ec-b909-0242ac120002 generated by the sample code, the full sample request and parameters are like below.

### Example request - Accepting Payments

You can copy the link and open it in a brower:

```
https://mixpay.me/pay?payeeId=a38ed284-5689-4fb9-8c2a-91fba5e32ce9&settlementAssetId=c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa&quoteAssetId=usd&traceId=dd9c3e04-a5d2-11ec-b909-0242ac120002&remark=xxxxxx
```

### Parameters

|  Param | Optional | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `payeeId` | <span class="required">*required</span> | String | three settlement modes are supported, normal user, robot, and multisig group, so it is usually the Mixin UUID of a normal user or robot, and you can also specify the multisigId of a sub-account. |
| `settlementAssetId` | optional |  String | assetId of settlement cryptocurrency. Settlement assets you prefer. If left blank, the payee will receive the cryptocurrency the user pays for. |
| `quoteAssetId` | optional |  String | assetId of quote cryptocurrency, the asset include cryptocurrency and fiat currency. |
| `quoteAmount` | optional |  Numeric | Amount of cryptocurrency received, if left blank, the user can enter manually. |
| `remark` | optional |  String | Payment remark viewable by the payee. |
| `traceId` | optional |  String | UUID, used to prevent double payment. |

### Step 2 - Covert the payment link to QR code

Then you can covert the payment link which generated by the above step to a QR code, maybe you can use some library depends on your program language.

### Step 3 - Look query the payment results

Then you can use this [api](https://developers.mixpay.me/api/payments/payments-results) to loop query payments result, the parameter is the `traceId` you generated. And the response is the `status` of payment. The `status` has three parameters, unpaid, failed and success.

1.  Register Mixin Messenger and add MixPay(**[7000104220](https://mixin.one/codes/e836b0e7-96a7-4fc9-a79f-1f795ca4d6fa)**) bot.
2.  Provide your **Mixin ID** and **settlement asset** to Point-of-Sale (PoS) developers.
