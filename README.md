## Introduction

> MixPay, Decentralized Web3 Payment Protocol.

[MixPay Protocol](https://mixpay.me/) is a decentralized web3 payment protocol, which connects different chains, different tokens, different wallets, and exchanges, whether it is an on-chain wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet) or a centralized wallet (Blockchain.com, BlockFi), or exchanges (Binance, Coinbase). As long as they access the MixPay Protocol, they can provide their users with safe, simple, and free payment services anywhere in the world marked by MixPay, without merchants needing to care about what wallet or token the customer uses to pay, just like what Visa and Mastercard do in the traditional payment field.

You only need to specify a certain amount of currency to MixPay, the user choose any cryptocurrency to pay, and MixPay converts them automatically. For example, suppose there is a current commodity valued at $10 that needs to be payed, the merchant can choose to charge $10 in BTC or any cryptocurrency, and the user can choose to pay $10 in USDT or any cryptocurrency. And all this can be achieved only by scanning the QR code using  [Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger).
