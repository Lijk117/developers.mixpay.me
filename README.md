> MixPay, Payment for Web3.

## Introduction

MixPay is a decentralized crypto payment service platform built on [Mixin Network](https://developers.mixin.one/docs/introduction). You only need to specify a certain amount of currency to MixPay, the user choose any cryptocurrency to pay, and MixPay converts them automatically. For example, suppose there is a current commodity valued at $10 that needs to be payed, the merchant can choose to charge $10 in BTC or any cryptocurrency, and the user can choose to pay $10 in USDT or any cryptocurrency. And all this can be achieved only by scanning the QR code using  [Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger).
